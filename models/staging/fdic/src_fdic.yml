      description: 'Represents the sum of the following: interest-rate contracts (as
        defined as the notional value of interest-rate swap, futures, forward and
        option contracts), foreign-exchange-rate contracts, commodity contracts and
        equity contracts (defined similarly to interest-rate contracts).Futures and
        forward contracts are contracts in which the buyer agrees to purchase and
        the seller agrees to sell, at a specified future date, a specific quantity
        of underlying at a specified price or yield. These contracts exist for a variety
        of underlyings, including traditional agricultural or physical commodities,
        as well as currencies and interest rates. Futures contracts are standardized
        and are traded on organized exchanges which set limits on counterparty credit
        exposure. Forward contracts do not have standardized terms and are traded
        over the counter.Option contracts are contracts in which the buyer acquires
        the right to buy from or sell to another party some specified amount of underlying
        at a stated price (strike price) during a period or on a specified future
        date, in return for compensation (such as a fee or premium). The seller is
        obligated to purchase or sell the underlying at the discretion of the buyer
        of the contract. Swaps are obligations between two parties to exchange a series
        of cash flows at periodic intervals (settlement dates) for a specified period.
        The cash flows of a swap are either fixed or determined for each settlement
        date by multiplying the quantity of the underlying instrument (notional principal)
        by specified reference rates or prices. Except for currency swaps, the notional
        principal is used to calculate each payment but is not exchanged.This item

      description: Amortized cost of structured notes (included in the held-to-maturity
        and available-for-sale accounts). Structured notes are debt securities that
        combine straight fixed or variable rate instruments and derivative products
        that are issued by corporations and government sponsored enterprises including
        FNMA, the Federal Home Loan Bank and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation.
        Structured notes generally contain embedded options such as call options,
        interest rate caps and interest rate floors. They typically have cash flows
        that are linked to indices such as interest rates, foreign exchange rates,
        commodity prices and other financial variables. The cash flows of structured
        notes can vary in the timing and amount of cash received by the investor throughout
        the life of the security. This makes the valuation of cash flows and risks
        of these securities a complex process. prior to 2004, This item is not available
