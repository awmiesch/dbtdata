A Subchapter S corporation is treated as a pass-through entity, similar to a partnership, for federal income tax purposes. It is generally not subject to any federal income taxes at the corporate level. Its taxable income flows through to its shareholders in proportion to their stock ownership, and the shareholders generally pay federal income taxes on their share of this taxable income. <i>This can have the effect of reducing institutions' reported taxes and increasing their after-tax earnings.</i>  The election of Subchapter S status may result in an increase in shareholders' personal tax liability. Therefore, some S corporations may increase the amount of earnings distributed as dividends to compensate for higher personal taxes.<br> <br><b> Trust Powers Granted </b>Institutions that have been granted trust powers by a state or national regulatory authority to administer accounts in a fiduciary capacity.
