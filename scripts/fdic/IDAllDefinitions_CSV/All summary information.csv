However, like a separate account life insurance policy, a hybrid policy’s cash surrender value is supported by assets segregated from the general assets of the insurance carrier. Because they are legally segregated, the assets of each separate account are not subject to claims on the insurer that arise out of any other business of the insurance company. Additionally, the bank holding the hybrid account life insurance policy is able to select the investment strategy in which the insurance premiums are invested. Under such an arrangement, the policyholder neither owns the underlying separate account created by the insurance carrier on its behalf nor controls investment. data available as of March 2011 for call reports only, not available for TFR filers.

"110.","Community Bank Leverage Ratio (Cblr) indicator (1=Yes)","CBLRIND"," Beginning in March 2020, 1 means YES, the institution has elected the community bank Leverage ratio (CBLR) framework for the quarter. the community bank leverage ratio (cblr) framework is an optional framework designed to reduce burden by removing the requirements for calculating and reporting risk-based capital ratios for qualifying community banking organizations that opt into the framework. The framework provides a simple measure of capital adequacy for qualifying community banking organizations, consistent with section 201 of the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act. The calculation of the Leverage Ratio is the percent of Tier 1 capital divided average total consolidated assets. Qualifying community banking organizations that elect to use the CBLR framework and that maintain a leverage ratio of greater than 9 percent are considered to have satisfied the risk-based and leverage capital requirements in the generally applicable capital rule. In addition, these institutions are considered to have met the well-capitalized ratio requirements for section 38 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act. If needed, there is a two-quarter grace period to meet the qualifying criteria again if an institution maintains a leverage ratio of 8 percent or greater. Temporarily under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act , as of June 2020 a banking organization with a leverage ratio of 8 percent or greater (and that meets the other existing qualifying criteria) may elect to use the community bank leverage ratio framework. If needed, there is a two-quarter grace period to meet the qualifying criteria again if an institution maintains a leverage ratio of 7 percent or greater. There are transition rules in place through the beginning of 2022 to return to the Leverage Ratio requirement to greater than 9 percent.  "
