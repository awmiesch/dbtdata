Then, you can look at the list and select the bank or thrift you are seeking. If you type the entire name, you must type the name exactly as it appears on our computerized structure files in order to find the correct institution. Refine your search. If you know the location, (city or state), where a bank is headquartered, you can obtain a list of all institutions in that location. The initial list will be sorted alphabetically. If you wish to sort the list by other criteria, i.e., by city, you can use the 'sort by' selection box at the top of the list. Inactive institutions. To find institutions that have merged, consolidated, or failed, use the 'Institution Status' selection to list 'Inactive' institutions. Display 'Demographic Information' to identify the institution that acquired an inactive bank or thrift. If you are unsure of the operating status of the institution, select “All” as “Institution Status”. Use the “Bank Find” feature to locate an institution. “Bank Find” found via the ID home page, offers a broader searching capability. For instance, if you are attempting to locate an active institution that once operated under a different name, an institution that once had FDIC insurance and subsequently voluntarily relinquished FDIC Insurance, or are unsure if the institution that you seek is a branch or the headquarters of the depository institution, use “Bank Find”. “Bank Find” can be found on the ID homepage. Please note that the “Find Institution” feature of ID is designed to display FDIC-insured institutions at specific instances in time. The name displayed for an active institution is either the current name of the institution or the name of the institution as of the quarter-end date that the user selects. The name displayed for an inactive institution is the last name used by an institution prior to inactivity. Also, those institutions that relinquished FDIC insurance prior to becoming inactive are not displayed when using the “Find Institution” feature of ID. Finally, “Find Institution” searches solely for the headquarters of the depository institution. “Find Office” and “Bank Find” search for offices (branches) of FDIC-insured institutions that are currently active. If you are still unable to find an institution: Please call the FDIC's Consumer Call Center at 800-934-FDIC or e-mail To: FDIC Information Request. "
