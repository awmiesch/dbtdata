"ID System: Goodwill and Other Intangibles"
"","Title","Variable","Definition"
"1.","Number of Institutions Reporting","instcnt","The number of institutions represented in that column of data.  This number is used primarily for peer group data. "
"2.","Goodwill and Other intangibles","intan","Intangible assets include goodwill, mortgage servicing rights, purchased credit card relationships and other identifiable intangible assets."
"3.","Goodwill","intangw"," The amount (book value) of unamortized goodwill. Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of a company over the sum of the fair values of the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired less the fair value of liabilities assumed in a business combination accounted for as a purchase. Goodwill and similar intangible assets ordinarily cannot be disposed of apart from an institution as a whole. Accordingly, a bank may not remove goodwill from its balance sheet by 'selling' or 'dividending' this asset to its parent holding company or another affiliate. An exception to the rule precluding the disposal of goodwill is made when a large segment or separable group of assets of an acquired company or an entire acquired company is sold or otherwise liquidated. In that case, some or all of the unamortized goodwill recognized in the acquisition should be included in the cost of the assets sold. The amount of goodwill reported in this item should not be reduced by any negative goodwill.  Any negative goodwill arising from a business combination accounted for as a purchase is reported in 'Other liabilities.'    Includes Goodwill and other intangible assets for TFR Reporters. "
"4.","Mortgage Servicing Assets","intanmsr","All servicing assets resulting from contracts to service loans secured by real estate."
"5.","All Other intangible Assets","INTANOTH","The amount of all other specifically identifiable intangible assets such as core deposit intangibles, favorable leasehold rights, purchased credit card relationships, and nonmortgage servicing assets."
"6.","Purchased Credit Card Relationships and Nonmortgage Servicing Before June 2018","intangcc"," Purchased credit card relationships represent the right to conduct ongoing credit card business dealings with the cardholders. In general, purchased credit card relationships are an amount paid in excess of the value of the purchased credit card receivables. Such relationships arise when the reporting bank purchases existing credit card receivables and also has the right to provide credit card services to those customers. Purchased credit card relationships may also be acquired when the reporting bank purchases an entire depository institution. Purchased credit card relationships are carried at amortized cost, not in excess of the discounted amount of estimated future net cash flows. Management of the institution reviews the carrying value at least quarterly, adequately documents this review, and adjusts the carrying value as necessary. If unanticipated acceleration or deceleration of cardholder payments, account attrition, changes in fees or finance charges, or other events occur that reduce the amount of expected future net cash flows, a write-down of the book value of the purchased credit card relationships is made to the extent that the discounted amount of estimated future net cash flows is less than the asset's carrying amount. The carrying value of nonmortgage servicing assets is the unamortized cost of acquiring contracts to service financial assets, other than loans secured by real estate, that have been securitized or are owned by another party, net of any related valuation allowances.    For TFR Reporters, includes nonmortgage servicing assets beginning March 1999. "
